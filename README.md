### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Niyi, a software developer from Canada, focused on web development.

I graduated with a computer science degree in 2008 and have been making websites professionally since. If you are reading this, code likely connects us in one way or another. Send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/NeoAdewole) telling me how.

This is a collection of project repos (many still in progress) of my Software developement journey. If you find something useful to you, feel free to open up and issue or send in helpful pull requests for your usecase. Please keep in mind that unless explicitly stated, nothing here is to be considered production safe.

I'm currently working on Mutter, a platform for community and collaboration amongst content creators, I will stream most of this on [Twitch](https://twitch.com/massmutter) while I get used to building in public.
